              EDGE bioinformatics is intended to help truly democratize the use of Next Generation
              Sequencing for exploring genomes and metagenomes. Given that bioinformatic analysis is
              now the rate limiting factor in genomics, we developed EDGE bioinformatics with a
              user-friendly interface that allows scientists to perform a number of tailored
              analyses using many cutting-edge tools.

            <h2>Features of EDGE</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            <ul>
              <li>No need for high-level bioinformaticists</li>
              <li>
                Allow users to address a wide range of use cases including the assembly/annotation
                and comparison of novel genomes, and the characterization of complex clinical or
                environmental samples
              </li>
              <li>
                Can present the results of several taxonomy classification tools for easy comparison
              </li>
              <li>Focus on accurate and rapid analysis</li>
              <li>
                Enables sequencing as a solution in facilities where human-resources, space,
                bandwidth, and time are limited
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br></br>
            <h2>Implementation</h2>
            <hr></hr>
            <ul>
              <li>
                EDGE Bioinformatics is built around a collection of publicly available, open-source
                software packaged or in-house developed tools/algorithms/scripts to process{' '}
                <b>FASTQ data</b> or <b>Contig FASTA data</b> (there is currently limited capability
                of incorporating PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data into the Assembly module)
              </li>
              <li>
                The EDGE bioinformatics web-based graphic user interface is primarily implemented
                using the MERN (MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, NodeJS) stack
              </li>
              <li>
                The current version of EDGE pipeline has been extensively tested on Linux platforms
                with Ubuntu 18.04 and CentOS 7 operation system and will only work on 64bit Linux
                environments
              </li>
              <li>
                Due to the involvement of several memory/time consuming steps, we normally recommend
                computers with at least 24GB memory and 8 CPUs, though we typically use on servers
                with a minimum of 256GB memory with 64 CPUs
              </li>
            </ul>
